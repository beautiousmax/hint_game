hint_game
=========

This is a game like Clue, but not copyright infringing. The object is to guess the name, place, and weapon of a recent murder before you 'die' and the game is over.


This was intended to be a learning tool for me. The goal was to write a complete script that would re-enforce newly learned techniques with strings, functions, dicts and lists. 


The game takes no options to start playing. 
```
python hint_game.py
